<h1>Hi there 👋</h1>

Striving towards technical excellence.

Hello! I'm a CS senior at UT Dallas. Last summer (2024) I worked at Tinker Airforce Base as a rotational software engineering intern where I got exposure to multiple languages and technologies. This year, I am currently on the job hunt again for a full-time SWE position.

Before coming to UT Dallas, I was an engineering major at Texas A&M, College Station. If you would like to know more about the projects I worked on in my previous experiences, or my portfolio, please go to my website.

🌱 I’m currently learning about ML/AI and Cybersecurity and building my portfolio.

🧐 Don't hesitate to reach out.
